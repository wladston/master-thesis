\chapter{Movie Data Processing and Success Prediction}
\label{chapter:model}
This chapter presents the methodology necessary to predict movie success and a
characterization of the dataset. We start by describing the steps for
filtering, processing and interpreting the dataset along with characterizations
in Section~\ref{sec:dataset_interpret}. Then, we present our new methodology to
correctly interpret the dataset into movie parameters suitable for analysis in
a prediction model in Section~\ref{sec:features}â€“this includes movie success
parameters and social parameters from movie-producing teams. In
Section~\ref{sec:feature_char}, we characterize the dataset in terms of such
parameters. In Section~\ref{sec:feature_interac}, we discuss feature
interaction. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:model:prediction}, we present and
describe the prediction model and methodology employed to assess how movie
characteristics are related to movie success.

\input{dataset}  % this is how we interpret the dataset.
\input{features}  % this is how we define features from teams
\input{charac}  % this is how we define features from teams
\input{interaction}  % this is how we define features from teams
\input{prediction}  % and this is how we predict team success
