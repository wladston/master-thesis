\chapter{Success Prediction Model Analysis}
\label{chapter:analysis}
In this chapter, we present our methodology and experimental results related to
the prediction model presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter:model}. We begin with
the methodology in Section~\ref{sec:method}, which presents our approach for
assessing the predictive model's accuracy according to different types of input
features. Then, in Section~\ref{sec:featureselection}, we present our approach
for analyzing all 121 features from Table~\ref{tab:features} in order to select
the ones that show a \textit{greater dependence}\footnote{Dependence is the
statistical relationship between two sets of data.} with movie success.
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:results}, we present and discuss results, showing
they confirm the main hypothesis of this work, which is: \textit{In a
multivariate predictive analysis of movie success, using many topological
features from teams leads to a more accurate analysis.}
