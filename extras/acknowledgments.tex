Foremost, I would like to express my greatest gratitude to my advisor,
Prof.~Mirella Moro, for always supporting my research with patience, knowledge
and invaluable insight. She gave me the freedom to explore research questions
that most interested me, while always guiding me towards producing relevant
work. I owe all my academic achievements to her. I thank my co-advisor,
Prof.~Ana Paula Couto, for helping me reach a higher technical quality in this
work.

I would also like to thank my parents for greatly encouraging me to research,
my friends Rômulo, Christophe and Leonardo for pushing me and cheering me up in
the hardest times. I thank Prof.~Fabricio Benevenuto and Prof.~Krishna Gummadi,
who together with my advisor Mirella set me on this path.

I thank my fellow colleague Pedro Santos, for working with me and being a great
companion in the earliest phase of the research. Finally, I'd like to thank
Dr.~Ronan Rêgo, for providing me the means to keep working when adverse moments
arose. I also thank my friend Raimondo Pictet for helping me review the final
work.
